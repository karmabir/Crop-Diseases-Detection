The productivity and quality of crops are greatly influenced by various diseases and pests. These are one of a kind of natural disasters which affect the natural growth of plants and can even cause the death of the plants ultimately affecting the yield of the crops. Detection of these diseases is henceforth really important. This kind of detection for various diseases can be done via image processing or object detection. Deep Learning techniques are greatly used for these kinds of tasks since they significantly outperform the conventional approaches which can include K-means clustering or even support vector machines. Detecting crop pests and diseases using state-of-the-art algorithms has become a major discussion topic. This research paper provides a comparison of various state-of-the-art algorithms based on convolutional neural networks which include InceptionV3, Resnet-50, VGG-16, AlexNet, MobileNetV3 and InceptionResV2. This paper also examines the potential difficulties in deep learning-based plant disease and pest identification in real-world settings. In addition, a number of recommendations are made as well as potential research directions and remedies for the problems. Finally, this paper analyses and predicts the future direction of deep learning-based plant disease and pest detection.
